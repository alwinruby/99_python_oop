# *99 Python OOP*

### *Getting back into programming*

In generic OO terminology, a "method" is defined on an object, and contains behavior.
You "send a message" to an object to invoke behavior, it might be more common to hear "function" rather
than method, or "call" instead of send.

While the terms method and function are generally interchangeable, the words send and call imply slightly different
things. Understanding this difference is important for your OO mindset.

Referring to the act of invoking behavior as "calling" a method or function suggests that you know what that called code does.

        * Assignments is a count of variable assignments.
        * Branches counts not branches of an if statement (as one could forgivably infer) but
        branches of control, meaning function calls or message sends.
        * Conditions counts conditional logic
